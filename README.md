# Brain-Tumour-Detection-Python
Brain tumor at early stage is very difficult task for doctors to identify. MRI images are more prone to noise and other environmental interference. So it becomes difficult for doctors to identify tumor and their causes. So here i come up with the system, where system will detect brain tumor from images. Here i will convert image into grayscale image. i applied filter to image to remove noise and other environmental interference from image. User has to select the image. System will process the image by applying image processing steps. i applied a unique algorithm to detect tumor from brain image. But edges of the image are not sharp in early stage of brain tumor. So i applied image segmentation on image to detect edges of the images. In this method i applied image segmentation to detect tumor. Here i proposed image segmentation process and many image filtering techniques for accuracy. This system is implemented in Python.
